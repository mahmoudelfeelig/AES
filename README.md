# 🔐 AES

A lightweight and educational implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in C++. This project provides a clear view of the inner workings of AES, including key expansion, encryption rounds, and byte-level transformations.

Ideal for cryptography students or anyone seeking to understand symmetric key encryption at a low level.
