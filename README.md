# AES

A lightweight and educational implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in assembly. This project provides a clear view of the inner workings of AES, including key expansion, encryption rounds, and byte-level transformations.

Ideal for cryptography students or anyone seeking to understand symmetric key encryption at a low level.

## Features

- AES-128 encryption implementation
- Full round operations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey)
- Key expansion algorithm
- Testable with sample plaintext and keys
- Written for readability and learning

## Concepts Covered

- Block cipher mechanics
- Substitution-permutation networks
- Rijndael S-box and inverse S-box
- Round constants (Rcon) and key schedule
- Byte-level bitwise operations

## Educational Goals

This project is built to:

- Illustrate each stage of AES encryption in assembly
- Serve as a base for experimenting with cryptographic ideas
- Provide a transparent, step-by-step view of how AES operates
